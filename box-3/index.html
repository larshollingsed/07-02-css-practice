      Maybe you feel like choosing between two arrows.  Possible a left arrow and a right arrow; how do you feel about those options?
    </p>
    <div id="arrows">
      <div id="box_left">
        <img alt="arrow pointing left" src="http://e404themes.com/ice/wp-content/themes/ice/images/icons/arrow-left.png">
      </div>
      <div id="box_right">
        <img alt="arrow pointing right" src="http://e404themes.com/ice/wp-content/themes/ice/images/icons/arrow-right.png">
      </div>
      <!-- disallows this next <p> to come up and wrap around the 
           arrows' columns -->
      <div style="clear: both" />
      <p>
        So choosing arrows is pretty fun.  I suppose they could be pointing up and down.  Or even on a third axis.  Could get pretty crazy...who knows?
